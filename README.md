# Action on Google Ubike

This project consists in an firebase cloud functions that is used in the Google Action called `Mister Ubike`.
I created this Action on Google to avoid using the Ubike App, since I had to login every freaking time...

## Usage
In the future you will probably find this Action on Google on the Google Assistant "marketplace" (I'm Working on that)

### Structure
Inside the `functions` folder you can find the following files:
The `IPLController.js` which is responsible of handling the authentication with the IPL Login Page (some scraping magic here üòÅ)   
The `UbikeController.js` which handles the authentication with the Ubike API and the bike unlocking process.

### Deployment

```
cd functions
npm install
npm run deploy
```

### Development
You can run the cloud function locally using this steps:
```
cd functions
npm install
npm run start
```
